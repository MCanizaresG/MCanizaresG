- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Manuel CaÃ±izares
I'm a math PhD student in the Harmonic Analysis group at BCAM, in Bilbao (Spain). I'm currently working in the area of inverse problems. I'm learning to use git with
GitHub while writing my first paper. On the one hand, I want to make the writing and reviewing process more efficient. On the other hand, since I also like programming,
I would like to have good command of git in case I get involved in a coding project at some point.
